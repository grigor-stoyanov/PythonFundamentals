<p class="yellow">Imagine being brown, you get invited to anub, happiest day of your life, you've trained for this, you go there
    blasting that 8k dps, it's everything you'd ever hoped for. You're having a stroll through fires and bugs and
    suddenly you see big red arrow on head, you have to run for a little bit, 15 seconds, spikes are catching up to you,
    it's getting very steamy. You can A)Keep running and hopefully outrun spikes B)Intervene to a guy that's waiting on
    the side C)Die like a big hairy chested brown that you are and get ressed. You have a split second to make the
    decision, you think to yourself:"You can do it, you've trained all your life for this". This is it, you intervene
    into the middle of the whole raid getting spikes to kill most of the raid and ripping 50 tries in the process.

<p>Xad Uau... i bet everyone in <italy>guilds united discord, which btw is public to join not private at all as you say, would
    be laughing their ass off if they read this. Ill give you extra points for originality thats for sure. But
    unfortunally the reality is less exciting.</italy>   We are there to be able to talk with each other without the pain of
    having to whisper and wait ppl to come online and repeat the same message multiple times. Its just to keep us
    connected and <strong> adverttise streams videos etc. To LFM chanell when trying to make a group and sell recipes etc. Anyway
    Azathothh at the end of</strong> the day there will allways be trolls and people trying their hardest to start drama.
    Again... great originality thats for sure ahah</p>
